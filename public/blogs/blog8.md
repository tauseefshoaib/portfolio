# Offline-First React Native Apps

Offline support is a product feature, not a nice-to-have.

## Core Pieces

- Local persistence (SQLite/MMKV)
- Cache invalidation strategy
- Sync queue for write operations

## UX Matters

Show connection state, queue updates, and keep the UI usable.

## Final Take

Offline-first makes apps resilient and trusted.
