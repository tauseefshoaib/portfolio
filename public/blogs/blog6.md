# State Management in React Native: What Actually Works

The best state solution is the simplest one that stays maintainable.

## Options in Practice

- Context for small shared state
- Redux Toolkit for complex app flows
- Zustand for fast, minimal state stores

## Choosing the Right Tool

If the state is local, keep it local. Only lift state when multiple screens truly need it.

## Final Take

Pick the simplest tool that your team can reason about consistently.
