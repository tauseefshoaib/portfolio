# Forms in React Native Without the Pain

Forms are where UX usually breaks first. Keep them fast, clear, and forgiving.

## Patterns That Help

- Validate as the user types
- Use clear inline errors
- Avoid re-rendering the whole form on each keystroke

## Choose Tools Carefully

Formik or React Hook Form can help, but over-abstracting can slow you down.

## Final Take

Good forms feel invisible. Aim for speed and clarity.
