# Testing React Native: Unit, Integration, E2E

Testing should reduce risk, not slow you down. A clear testing pyramid keeps it balanced.

## The Pyramid

- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for component behavior
- E2E tests for critical flows

## Common Tools

Jest for unit tests, React Native Testing Library for components, Detox for E2E.

## Final Take

Automate the critical paths and keep tests maintainable.
