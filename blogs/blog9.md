# Theming and Design Systems in React Native

Consistent UI comes from a simple, reusable design system.

## Build With Tokens

Define spacing, color, typography, and radius tokens at the base layer.

## Components With Variants

Buttons, inputs, and cards should support variants driven by the theme.

## Final Take

A small, well-defined system scales better than ad-hoc styles.
